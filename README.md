CP3402 week 6 Learning journal

1.Learning Activities & Resources
The main task this week was to learn how to write PHP files, from which I learned that PHP is a server-side scripting language widely used for web development. In a PHP file, you can embed PHP code within HTML or other markup languages, and the server processes the PHP code to generate dynamic content that is then sent to the client's web browser.I encountered many difficulties while I was completing this week's assignment because this was my first contact with php and it was a completely new language to me.

2.Estimated Hours Approximately 
up 7 hours, Since I am using a programming language that I have never been exposed to this week, it will take a long time to learn.

3.Content Insights
PHP files can perform various tasks such as interacting with databases, processing form data, and dynamically generating content based on user input. So php is a powerful server-side scripting language for web development.

4.Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Through this week's study, I came into contact with PHP and learned how it works and learned to write simply. This will be of great benefit to me in my future work. If I am a website developer, this will be something I must master. This week's learning is equivalent to getting me started.
