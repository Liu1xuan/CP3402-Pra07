CP3402 week 6 Learning journal

1.Learning Activities & Resources
The main task this week was to learn how to write PHP files, from which I learned that PHP is a server-side scripting language widely used for web development. In a PHP file, you can embed PHP code within HTML or other markup languages, and the server processes the PHP code to generate dynamic content that is then sent to the client's web browser.I encountered many difficulties while I was completing this week's assignment because this was my first contact with php and it was a completely new language to me. Its syntax was very different from the C++ or python I had learned. The difference, so in the process I studied on the Internet, the following are some resources I have readï¼š

2.Estimated Hours Approximately 
up 7 hours, Since I am using a programming language that I have never been exposed to this week, it will take a long time to learn.

3.Content Insights
PHP files can perform various tasks such as interacting with databases, processing form data, and dynamically generating content based on user input. So php is a powerful server-side scripting language for web development.
For the task demo, I will explain below:
Echo - Outputting Different Kinds of HTML:

echo is a keyword in PHP used for output. You can use it to output HTML tags, text, and other content.
Decisions - if/else Statements:

Using if and else statements, you can execute different code blocks based on conditions. For example, if it's sunny, output one message; otherwise, output another.
Repetition - for, while, foreach Loops (Using Arrays):

A for loop allows you to repeat a code block a specified number of times.
A while loop repeats a code block as long as a condition is true.
foreach loop is used to iterate through each element in an array.
Functions - Functions with Parameters:

In PHP, you can create functions with parameters, allowing you to use code blocks more flexibly.
Include - Including Common Header and/or Footer Using Include:

Using the include statement, you can include one PHP file into another. This is useful for sharing common headers and footers across multiple pages.

4.Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Through this week's study, I came into contact with PHP and learned how it works and learned to write simply. This will be of great benefit to me in my future work. If I am a website developer, this will be something I must master. This week's learning is equivalent to getting me started.
